# Quantizer

This class enables the user to apply (albeit rough) quantization to the signals received from their Platronica PLAYTRON device.
The user may pass the following arguments to the `Player` class:
```
tempo <-- tempo in BPM (60 is passed by default)
metronome <-- Boolean value indicating whether to play a metronome click at the start of every measure (True by default)
```
